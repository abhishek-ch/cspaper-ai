    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure OpenAI Key
    * If Using OpenAI key, simply `export OPENAI_API_KEY=*****`

## ðŸ”§ Usage

### Upload Data in Qdrant Vector Database
 
 1. Copy all desired PDFs in a directory
 2. Update the directory path in `./config.py` >> `pdf_uploadpath`
 3. Run the command

 ```python
    python -m paperai upload
```
 
__Its a 1 time job and once, the pdfs are loaded then user can ignore this step for next runs__


### Run the Tool

```python
python -m paperai run
```

## Known Issues
1. The Qdrant Vector Database is currently not operating in server mode, therefore document uploads are only permitted once. If new PDFs are to be added, it is necessary to delete the collection using `client.delete_collection(collection_name="test_papers")` and then re-upload the documents.
